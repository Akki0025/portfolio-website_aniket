# portfolio-website

This is my portfolio website — a Next.js project to showcase my projects and achievements.

About this project
------------------
This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and uses the
app directory (Next.js App Router).

Getting started
---------------
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Edit `app/page.tsx` to start editing the site — the page will auto-update as you edit.

Notes
-----
- This project uses `next/font` for automatic font optimization.
- See the Next.js docs for guidance on building and deploying: https://nextjs.org/docs

Deploy
------
You can deploy this site using Vercel (the platform behind Next.js) or any static host that supports Next.js.
